This is our DATA 2020 project repository. Here, we reproduce the work from the paper "Bayesian Regression Tree Models for Causal Inference‚Äù by Hahn et. al. We generate covariates and from there,  calculate propensity scores and assign treatments. We then simulate outcomes for four different generated datasets across three types of models: BCF, BART, and Lasso Regression. Through these simulations, we test model performance with a variety of evaluation metrics, and find that BCF performs better than BART and Lasso, obtaining similar results to the paper.
